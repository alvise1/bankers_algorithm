# Banker's Algorithm Simulation

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in C, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm commonly used in operating systems.
The program simulates resource allocation among multiple processes while ensuring system safety.

## Features

- Simulates a multi-process environment with shared resources.
- Handles resource allocation and release requests.
- Verifies system safety using the Banker's Algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- Make utility installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:alvise1/bankers_algorithm.git
   cd bankers_algorithm
2. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    make
3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./main
